## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to achieve loose coupling between classes or components by externalizing their dependencies. In simpler terms, it's a way of passing objects (dependencies) into a class rather than the class creating those objects itself.

Imagine you have a class called `Car` that needs an `Engine` object to function. Without Dependency Injection, the `Car` class might create an `Engine` object internally:

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Creating the Engine object internally
    }
}
```

With Dependency Injection, the `Car` class doesn't create the `Engine` object itself. Instead, it's provided with the `Engine` object from the outside:

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine; // Engine object is passed in from outside
    }
}
```

Here, the `Car` class depends on an `Engine` object, but it's not responsible for creating it. Instead, the `Engine` object is "injected" into the `Car` class from the outside, typically through its constructor.

Dependency Injection promotes modularity, testability, and flexibility in software development:

- **Modularity**: Classes become more modular and focused on specific tasks when they don't create their own dependencies.
  
- **Testability**: It becomes easier to test classes in isolation by providing mock or stub objects during testing, rather than relying on real implementations of dependencies.
  
- **Flexibility**: By externalizing dependencies, different implementations of the same interface can be swapped in and out without modifying the classes that depend on them. This allows for easier configuration and adaptation to changing requirements.

In summary, Dependency Injection is a technique for managing dependencies in software development, where dependencies are provided to a class from the outside rather than being created internally. This promotes loose coupling, modularity, testability, and flexibility in the codebase.
