## Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

##### Example in Node.js:
In this example, the Composite Pattern is used to represent an organization hierarchy. `Employee` is the component interface, with `Developer` and `Designer` as leaf components and `Manager` as the composite component. `Manager` can contain both leaf employees and other managers as subordinates. Clients can interact with the composite structure uniformly using the `display()` method, which recursively displays the hierarchy of employees.

```javascript
// Component interface
class Employee {
  constructor(name, position) {
    this.name = name;
    this.position = position;
  }

  display() {}
}

// Leaf
class Developer extends Employee {
  display() {
    console.log(`Developer: ${this.name}, ${this.position}`);
  }
}

// Leaf
class Designer extends Employee {
  display() {
    console.log(`Designer: ${this.name}, ${this.position}`);
  }
}

// Composite
class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name, position);
    this.subordinates = [];
  }

  add(employee) {
    this.subordinates.push(employee);
  }

  display() {
    console.log(`Manager: ${this.name}, ${this.position}`);
    this.subordinates.forEach(employee => {
      employee.display();
    });
  }
}

// Usage
const john = new Developer('John', 'Developer');
const jane = new Designer('Jane', 'Designer');
const bob = new Manager('Bob', 'Project Manager');

bob.add(john);
bob.add(jane);

bob.display();
```

Now for the Pros & Cons:
##### Pros:

1. **Flexibility**: The Composite Pattern provides a flexible way to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to work with individual objects and compositions of objects interchangeably.

2. **Simplified Client Code**: Clients can interact with complex tree structures using a uniform interface, simplifying client code and making it more intuitive.

3. **Scalability**: The pattern supports the addition of new components to the composite structure without changing existing code, promoting scalability and ease of extension.

4. **Encapsulation**: The Composite Pattern encapsulates the complex structure of objects within composite objects, hiding implementation details from clients and promoting code maintainability.

5. **Recursive Structure**: It allows operations to be recursively applied to composite objects and their children, enabling powerful traversal and manipulation algorithms.

##### Cons:

1. **Complexity**: Implementing the Composite Pattern may introduce additional complexity, especially when dealing with deeply nested structures or when operations need to be applied recursively.

2. **Uniform Interface Limitations**: While providing a uniform interface for both leaf and composite objects simplifies client code, it may also limit the operations that can be performed on individual objects.

3. **Performance Overhead**: Traversing and operating on composite structures may incur a performance overhead, especially in deeply nested structures, due to the recursive nature of operations.

4. **Design Overkill**: For simple part-whole hierarchies or when operations on individual components are limited, applying the Composite Pattern may be overkill and could unnecessarily complicate the design.

5. **Type Safety**: The pattern typically uses a common interface for both leaf and composite objects, which may lead to type safety issues if clients assume certain behavior that is not supported by all components.
