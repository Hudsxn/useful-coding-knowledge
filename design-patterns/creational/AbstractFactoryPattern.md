## Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern is another creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 

##### NodeJS example:
```javascript
// Abstract Product interfaces
class Button {
  paint() {}
}

class Checkbox {
  paint() {}
}

// Concrete Product classes
class MacOSButton extends Button {
  paint() {
    console.log('Rendering MacOS button');
  }
}

class WindowsButton extends Button {
  paint() {
    console.log('Rendering Windows button');
  }
}

class MacOSCheckbox extends Checkbox {
  paint() {
    console.log('Rendering MacOS checkbox');
  }
}

class WindowsCheckbox extends Checkbox {
  paint() {
    console.log('Rendering Windows checkbox');
  }
}

// Abstract Factory interface
class GUIFactory {
  createButton() {}
  createCheckbox() {}
}

// Concrete Factory implementations
class MacOSFactory extends GUIFactory {
  createButton() {
    return new MacOSButton();
  }
  createCheckbox() {
    return new MacOSCheckbox();
  }
}

class WindowsFactory extends GUIFactory {
  createButton() {
    return new WindowsButton();
  }
  createCheckbox() {
    return new WindowsCheckbox();
  }
}

// Usage
const os = 'macOS'; // or 'Windows'
let factory;

if (os === 'macOS') {
  factory = new MacOSFactory();
} else if (os === 'Windows') {
  factory = new WindowsFactory();
}

const button = factory.createButton();
button.paint(); // Output: Rendering MacOS button (or Rendering Windows button)

const checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
checkbox.paint(); // Output: Rendering MacOS checkbox (or Rendering Windows checkbox)
```

#### Pros & Cons

##### Pros
1. **Encapsulation**: It encapsulates the creation of multiple related objects, ensuring that the client code remains decoupled from the specifics of object creation.

2. **Flexibility**: Abstract factories allow switching between different families of products, providing flexibility in creating related objects with varying implementations.

3. **Consistency**: Abstract factories ensure that the created objects are compatible and work well together since they are part of the same family of products.

4. **Scalability**: It's easier to extend the abstract factory to support new types of products or variations within existing families, making the pattern suitable for scalable applications.

5. **Separation of Concerns**: Abstract factories promote the separation of concerns by dividing the responsibility of object creation from the rest of the application logic.

##### Cons:

1. **Complexity**: Implementing the Abstract Factory Pattern can introduce additional complexity, especially if there are many families of products and variations within each family.

2. **Increased Number of Classes**: It may lead to an increased number of classes in the codebase, especially if there are multiple abstract factories and corresponding concrete factories.

3. **Runtime Overhead**: Abstract factories may introduce runtime overhead due to the additional abstraction layer involved in creating objects.

4. **Tighter Coupling**: Clients using abstract factories are tightly coupled to the abstract product interfaces, which may reduce flexibility in certain scenarios where dynamic object creation is required.

5. **Limited Extensibility**: Adding new types of products or variations within existing families may require modifying the abstract factory interface and all its implementations, which can be cumbersome.
