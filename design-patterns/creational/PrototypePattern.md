## Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the creation of new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype, rather than creating new instances using constructors. 


##### NodeJS example:

In this example, carPrototype serves as the prototype object, and new instances of cars are created by cloning this prototype using the clone() method. Modifications made to cloned instances do not affect the original prototype object, demonstrating the ability to create independent instances with shared characteristics.

```javascript
// Prototype object
const carPrototype = {
  wheels: 4,
  make: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Camry',
  clone() {
    return Object.create(this);
  }
};

// Cloning the prototype
const car1 = carPrototype.clone();
console.log(car1); // Output: { wheels: 4, make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry' }

// Modifying cloned object
car1.model = 'Corolla';

// Cloning another instance
const car2 = carPrototype.clone();
console.log(car2); // Output: { wheels: 4, make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry' }

// Original prototype remains unchanged
console.log(carPrototype); // Output: { wheels: 4, make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry' }
```

Now for the pros and cons

##### Pros:

1. **Reduced Object Creation Overhead**: Since new objects are created by cloning existing objects, the overhead of creating new objects from scratch, especially if they are complex or require significant initialization, is reduced.

2. **Dynamic Object Creation**: Prototypes allow for dynamic object creation at runtime based on existing objects, providing flexibility in object creation and configuration.

3. **Flexibility**: It provides a way to configure and customize object creation by modifying the prototype object, enabling variations and configurations without changing the original object's structure.

4. **Encapsulation**: Prototype objects encapsulate the initialization logic within themselves, allowing clients to create new objects without needing to know the details of object initialization.

5. **Performance**: Prototypes can improve performance in situations where object creation is expensive, such as database or network operations, by avoiding redundant initialization steps.

##### Cons:

1. **Complexity**: Implementing the Prototype Pattern may add complexity to the codebase, especially if the prototype objects or the cloning process are complex.

2. **Deep Copying**: Cloning complex objects may require deep copying to ensure that all properties and nested objects are properly copied, which can be challenging to implement correctly.

3. **Object Identity**: Prototypes may lose object identity, as they create new instances that are distinct from the original prototype object, which may lead to unexpected behavior if object identity is important.

4. **State Management**: Managing the state of cloned objects, especially if they contain mutable state, can be challenging and may require additional mechanisms to ensure consistency.

5. **Prototype Pollution**: In dynamic languages, careless use of prototype cloning can lead to prototype pollution, where unintended properties are added to objects, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
