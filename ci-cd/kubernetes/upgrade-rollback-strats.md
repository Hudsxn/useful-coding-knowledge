## CI/CD > Kubernetes > Upgrades and Rollbacks in Kubernetes

[<- To Kubernetes](./index.md)

---

Upgrades and rollbacks are essential processes in managing Kubernetes clusters and applications, enabling operators to deploy new versions of applications, Kubernetes itself, or underlying infrastructure changes safely and efficiently.

### Upgrades

Kubernetes upgrades involve updating the Kubernetes control plane components (e.g., API server, scheduler, controller manager) and node components (e.g., kubelet, kube-proxy) to a newer version. Upgrades may also include updating container runtime versions, networking plugins, or other cluster add-ons.

#### Upgrade Strategies

1. **Control Plane Upgrades**: Upgrade the control plane components one by one to minimize downtime and ensure availability.
2. **Node Upgrades**: Drain and evict Pods from nodes before upgrading node components to avoid disrupting application workloads.
3. **Rolling Upgrades**: Perform rolling upgrades for stateless applications to ensure zero downtime. For stateful applications, use stateful set rolling updates or other application-specific strategies to minimize disruption.
4. **Upgrade Testing**: Test upgrades in staging environments before applying them to production clusters to identify and mitigate any potential issues.

### Rollbacks

Rollbacks are necessary when an upgrade or configuration change causes unexpected issues or disruptions to application workloads. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for rolling back changes to a previous known-good state.

#### Rollback Strategies

1. **Kubectl Rollback**: Use the `kubectl rollout undo` command to rollback Deployments, DaemonSets, or StatefulSets to a previous revision.
2. **Automated Rollback**: Implement automated rollback mechanisms using CI/CD pipelines or custom controllers to detect issues and trigger rollbacks automatically.
3. **Canary Deployments**: Use canary deployments to gradually roll out changes to a subset of users or traffic, allowing for rapid detection of issues and minimizing the impact of rollbacks.
4. **Rollback Testing**: Test rollback procedures regularly to ensure they are effective and reliable in reverting changes safely.

### Best Practices

1. **Backup Data**: Backup critical data before performing upgrades or major changes to the cluster to mitigate the risk of data loss.
2. **Monitor Health**: Monitor cluster health and application performance during upgrades and rollbacks to detect issues early and take corrective actions promptly.
3. **Incremental Upgrades**: Upgrade Kubernetes components and applications incrementally, one version at a time, to reduce complexity and minimize the risk of compatibility issues.
4. **Document Procedures**: Document upgrade and rollback procedures, including step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting tips, to ensure consistency and repeatability.
